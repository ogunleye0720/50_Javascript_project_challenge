## Progress step project
Progress steps are used to show progress of a task, such as uploading files, filling a form, signing up to a new account, ordering on an ecommerce website.
The Progress steps help to guide users through a number of steps in order to complete a certain task.
Some of the benefits of Progress steps/bars are;
- It creates a user interaction, which enables users to confirm that their transactions are successful 
- It helps reduce uncertainty and provide reassurance of the end users.
While implementing the Progress step project, I have learnt
1. How to use the document object Model Manupulation (DOM) to create some interactivity on the frontend.
2. I have learnt a logic which helped on incrementing pr decrementing the Progress bar on every clicks.
3. I learnt how to disable mouse activity on a button.
